## Introduction
The HR team is finding ways to reduce the overall attrition rates but first, an analysis must be carried out to give further insights.
By carefully examining the results of the analysis, the HR team can create focused initiatives that address the underlying reasons for attrition and promote an atmosphere that encourages employee retention and long-term commitment to the company. The insights presented here will help in decision-making.

## Problem Statement

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Python** for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
- **Tableau** for visualization

## Data Sourcing
The dataset was gotten from the [datacamp platform](https://github.com/Esther-Aj/HR_Analytics/tree/main/hr_data). It contains 3 tables.

- Employee
- Education
- Performance rating

## Analysis and Insights
From the analysis, the following can be observed;
- The company has 3 departments and 1,233 active employees, the majority of which are males aged 29 years on average.
- The majority of employees hold bachelor's degrees, demonstrating the independence of job functions from educational requirements.
- Whites and African Americans make up the majority of the workforce's ethnicity.
- In the last 10 years, work life balance has changed, with slightly more employees being satisfied and a high count of dissatisfied employees as well.
- Job satisfaction levels have been actively changing over the past ten years. The vast majority of employees were satisfied with their jobs from 2013 to 2016. Dissatisfaction levels increased in 2017, which may have been caused by a number of factors. In 2018, job satisfaction increased up until 2021 where there was a high rate of dissatisfaction among employees. This may have happened as a result of the impact of the covid pandemic's aftermath. In 2022, employees reported higher job satisfaction.
- In the past ten years, there has been a significant increase in employee job satisfaction, with the number of satisfied employees and the number of dissatisfied employees sharing a very small gap.
- The highest paid positions are in management or human resources, while tech experts work overtime and receive lesser pay, which is not consistent with the salaries provided throughout an IT organization.
- More than 16% of the workforce, with 56.12% of technology department, resigned. This analysis demonstrates that many resigned because  they were underpaid and worked overtime.
- In comparison to other genders, more men left the company.
- It is evident from the data that employees between the ages of 22 and 29 had the highest attrition rates.
- Employees who have worked for the company for a longer period of time have a lesser likelihood of resignation, and vice versa.

## Recommendations
- Investigate the factors that have influenced the fluctuating work-life balance satisfaction levels over the years.
- Address the issues brought up in 2017 and 2021 that contributed to an increase in employee dissatisfaction concentrating on improving those particular parts of the workplace.
- To enhance enthusiasm and increase job satisfaction among employees, recognise and reward exceptional performance.
- To make sure that all employees, especially IT professionals, are appropriately compensated for their roles and contributions, the compensation structure should be reviewed.
- Address the discrepancy between overtime expectations and pay in the IT department,to guarantee that workload and remuneration are in line.
- To keep valuable personnel, give them possibilities for professional advancement within the organisation.
- Create retention strategies that take into account the needs of various age groups, especially employees between the ages of 22 and 29 who have the most
